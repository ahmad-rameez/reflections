How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    As mentioned in the decription it is a nice tool if the lines are short.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

   It will save a lot of time by reducing the work of camparing files with
   thousand of lines of code. 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros - We will be having full control of what version of our file must be saved.
    Cons - Everytime we have to give command explicitly to commit.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because multiple files in a particular state defins the current progresss of project.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log shows each commit with its id title and no of insertion and deletion, whereas 
    git diff shows detailed view of insertion and deletion by comparing two commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Each time we commit our progresss is saved, we can switch to any earlier 
    version whenever we wish.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    For open source contribution.
